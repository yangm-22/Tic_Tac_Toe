# Tic Tac Toe
The goal of this project was to create a cybernetic system that senses its environment and produces responsive outputs/actions.  The sensor that I used was the touch screen. The actuators I used included the LCD screen, a piezoelectric vibration sensor, and an RGB LED. 

State 1 consists of a home screen where the user can press “Play” to start the game. The piezoelectric buzzer plays a song (the Harry Potter Theme Song) and the RGB LED flashes in the sequence of a rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple). The user button can be pressed to either turn off or turn on the song in State 1. The user button can be pressed to stop the song from playing. If the song is currently not playing and the user button is pressed, then the song will start playing once again. After the “Play” button is clicked on the LCD, it advances to State 2 where Player 1 (X) takes their turn. Once Player 1 makes a move, then it proceeds to State 3 where Player 2 (O) takes their turn and makes their move. This keeps alternating between State 2 and State 3 until one of the players meets the winning criteria for the game and gets three in a row or the nine spots on the board are all occupied. In State 2, when it is Player 1’s turn, the RGB LED will flash pink using pulse width modulation. This cycle of the RGB LED flashing a pink light will continue until it proceeds to the next state. When it is Player 2’s turn, the RGB LED will produce a blue light, using pulse width modulation to adjust the colour of the LED. This cycle of the RGB LED flashing a blue light will continue until it proceeds to the next state. If Player 1 (X) manages to get three “X” in a row, then Player 1 is the winner and it proceeds to State 4. The text “PLAYER 1 IS THE WINNER!” is displayed on the LCD screen and the RGB LED flashes a pink colour. If Player 2 (O) manages to get three “O” in a row, then Player 2 is the winner and it proceeds to State 5. The text “PLAYER 2 IS THE WINNER!” is displayed on the LCD screen and the RGB LED flashes a blue colour. If the board is full and neither player satisfies the winning condition, then it proceeds to State 6. The text “DRAW!” is displayed on the LCD screen and the RGB LED flashes red. The home button is displayed in State 4, State 5, and State 6 and once the user clicks on the home button on the LCD, it will bring the user back to State 1 and the piezo will play the song and the RGB LED will flash in a rainbow pattern. Threading was used to incorporate the piezo (thread 1) and the RGB LED (thread 2) into the game and both these threads had below normal priority. Event flags were utilized to play the song with the piezo at the appropriate times. A new library that was not used in the labs was “pitches.h” which was imported from the internet and this library was slightly modified to satisfy the requirements of the song being played on the piezo buzzer.
